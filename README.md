# Magic-The-Gathering-Projects
Magic: The Gathering, a trading card game created by Richard Garfield and released in 1993, is often considered as 
one of the best board games ever made. With it's large strategic appeal, high skill-cap, and complicated rule set, 
the game is revered for its challengingand analytical gameplay. Magic, however, is so much more than a collection of
cardboard pieces strung together in a web of nuanced rulesinteractions and emergent gameplay: it's also a game overflowing 
with unique art and storytelling possibilities. Each card, in addition to its mechanical rules text, incorporates a piece 
of original artwork, and about two-thirds of the cards further include italicized flavour text--short phrases that don't 
impact the gameplay but help build the world and events of the MtG multiverse. This project, then, analyses the flavour 
text of over 11000 Magic: The Gathering cards, and uses distant reading methods such as Sentiment Analysis, TF-IDF measurements,
and Topic Modelling to gain a better understanding of how the craft and wonder of Magic's storytelling has evolved since its inception.
